                Welcome to my blog! I will document over time my projects in my career in the software developing.

                <h2>My first website</h2>
                <p>I thought of documenting my projects. I came to the decision to create a blog on the world wide web.</p>
                <p>My primary objective was to obtain a domain and develop a website while keeping expenses at a minimum.</p>
                <div class="read-more-content">
                    <p>After quite some researching, I came to the conclusion to launch the website on <a
                            href="https://GitHub.com">GitHub.com.</a> In order to do that, a new repository is required. The name must be as follows: <i>'name'.github.io.</i></p>
                    <p>I obtained my <b>marlonbitiq.com</b> domain from the website <a
                            href="https://Squarespace.com">Squarespace.com.</a> I initially looked for a Google domain, but that changed, unfortunately.</p>
                    <p>I used Visual Studio Code to create my HTML and CSS scripts. It also enables me to submit my changes directly to GitHub. I used YouTube and the internet to find answers and learn newskills.</p>

                <h2>3D game in Unity</h2>
                <p>I decided to turn my school, Sekundarschule Horgen, into a 3D game using Unity to improve my creativeand technical skills.</p>
                <p>Despite facing setbacks, like losing the project and having to rebuild it, this experience showed my perseverance. </p>
                <div class="read-more-content">
                    <p>I navigated the complexities of 3D modeling and Unity programming, gaining insights that stressed the importance of careful planning for future projects.</p>
                    <p>The resulting 3D model captured the main features of the school, although some details were leftout due to time constraints.</p>
                    <p>In the end, this experience was not only rewarding but also set the foundation for my ongoing
                        exploration of programming and future projects.</p>
